# Random Password Generator in Python

This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on user-specified criteria. It uses the `string` and `random` libraries to create secure, unpredictable passwords.

## Features

- Generate a password of a user-defined length
- Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters
- Option to customize which characters should be included in the password

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-password-generator.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd random-password-generator
Usage
Basic Usage
Run the Python script directly to generate a random password.

bash
Copy code
python password_generator.py
Customizing the Password
You can customize the password generation by specifying the password length and character types to be included. The script will prompt you for the following:

Length of the password
Whether to include uppercase letters
Whether to include lowercase letters
Whether to include digits
Whether to include special characters
The script will then generate a secure, random password based on your selections.

Example:
bash
Copy code
Enter the desired length of the password: 12
Include uppercase letters (y/n): y
Include lowercase letters (y/n): y
Include digits (y/n): y
Include special characters (y/n): n
This will generate a password with 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase letters, and digits, but no special characters.

Script Code
python
Copy code
import string
import random

def generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_lowercase, use_digits, use_special_chars):
    all_characters = ""
    if use_uppercase:
        all_characters += string.ascii_uppercase
    if use_lowercase:
        all_characters += string.ascii_lowercase
    if use_digits:
        all_characters += string.digits
    if use_special_chars:
        all_characters += string.punctuation

    if len(all_characters) == 0:
        raise ValueError("At least one character set must be selected.")

    return ''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for _ in range(length))

def main():
    print("Random Password Generator")
    length = int(input("Enter the desired length of the password: "))
    use_uppercase = input("Include uppercase letters (y/n): ").lower() == 'y'
    use_lowercase = input("Include lowercase letters (y/n): ").lower() == 'y'
    use_digits = input("Include digits (y/n): ").lower() == 'y'
    use_special_chars = input("Include special characters (y/n): ").lower() == 'y'

    password = generate_password(length, use_uppercase, use_lowercase, use_digits, use_special_chars)
    print("Generated Password:", password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How It Works
The script first prompts the user for the password length and the types of characters to include.
It then builds a list of possible characters based on the user's choices.
A random password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the list.
Finally, the generated password is displayed to the user.
